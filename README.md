```

No external dependencies required — uses Python's built-in libraries.

## 🛠️ Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python Structure.py
```

Enter the full path to the folder when prompted:

```text
Enter the full path to the folder: C:\Users\Documents\MyFolder
```

You’ll see the folder structure printed in the terminal, like this:
